                We love grandfathers because they are great storytellers, listeners, and friends. 
                Their life experiences have made them wiser. 
                A well-deliberated tribute to a grandfather who recently passed away is a good way of letting others know how special he was for us. 
                I’ve always told you how special you were. You are full of kindness and love. 
                Our love remains tightly knit, even stronger as we’re apart. Sleep beautifully, Baba.
